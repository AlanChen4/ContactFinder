We have maintained the integrity of our purpose by strengthening our ties to the Jewish community and serving as a link between high school and career.</p>\r\n<p>Our heritage stems from one source: young Jewish men banding together in allegiance. The role of Alpha Epsilon Pi has expanded since its inception in 1913. Initially, the Jewish fraternity served as a brotherhood of young men who came from similar religious backgrounds and who had experienced the same prejudices against their religious beliefs. Alpha Epsilon Pi soon broadened its role to include serving as the living quarters for some of its members. The fraternity became a home away from home, providing the same stabilizing and guiding values that students previously gained from their families. Armed with these values, Alpha Epsilon Pi faced changing conditions on the college campus and survived. Today, Jewish students search out Alpha Epsilon Pi because it is a Jewish Fraternity. In the fraternity&rsquo;s 98-year history, over 93,000 men have worn the badge of Alpha Epsilon Pi and each year, over 2,500 undergraduates perform the Ritual of Initiation, which remains the same ritual adopted decades ago.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps of greater importance, Alpha Epsilon Pi develops leadership for the future of the American Jewish community. Tomorrow&rsquo;s Jewish leaders are in our chapters today. These are the young men who must be counted upon to support Jewish causes and to prepare to be one of tomorrow&rsquo;s Jewish leaders, so that they may aid themselves, their family, their community, and their people. Those students who enter the mainstream of non-Jewish life on the campus are far more likely to assimilate and to forsake their heritage. Working together with the Foundation for Jewish Campus Life/International Hillel, Alpha Epsilon Pi can play a vital role in helping reverse the growing trend among our young people to abandon Judaism at this critical time.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout our history, the fraternity setting has served as a &ldquo;learning laboratory&rdquo;, a testing ground for young men who later become leaders in business, education, government, religion, and science. A goal of our fraternity is to help each student to develop character, to learn responsibility, and to develop a proper set of values through living together in brotherhood.

Bethune envisioned NCNW serving as a clearinghouse, facilitating networking and coalition building, and advocating the use of collective power on issues affecting women, their families, and their communities. Today, NCNW sponsors educational, economic, social, and cultural projects nationally and locally to achieve equality of opportunity. Additionally, NCNW strives to eliminate prejudice and discrimination based upon race, creed, color, sex, or national origin.The University of Alabama Section of NCNW was founded in January 1998 by a group of young, independent, African American women that had a vision of empowering the female African American student population through NCNW.The mission of the National Council of Negro Women, Inc. is to advance opportunities and improve the quality of life for African American women, their familes, and communities.

Beginning on September 12, 1975, a series of interest meetings were held throughout the fall, on November 16, 1975 the selections of four candidate for membership into Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity was made. The four aspirants were Carl Cook, Kambeya wa Kambeya, Alfred Page, and Benjamin Thomas, Jr. Later two addition members were added, Billy Henderson and Jeffery Holsey, to surpass the requirement of five charter members.On December 3, 1975, following a meeting with the potential members, Brother Walton, on behalf of the six men, submitted a formal petition to the University's Office of Student Life and the Interfraternity Council for a charter to be a recognized Greek-letter student organization. In addition to the names of the six men, the petition included three members of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity who were in graduate school at the University of Alabama: Brother Charles McPherson, Brother Larry Ruby, and Brother Lonzell Wilson, whose inclusion enabled the Interfraternity Council to recognize the petition as meeting its required numbers.On December 5, 1975, a letter from the Office of the National Headquarters Building in Washington, DC, reached the Dean of Student Life at the University of Alabama, to notify the University of its approval of the establishment of a new chapter at the University. The new chapter came into official existence in January 1976, as five of the six candidates were initiated in the Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity. Benjamin Thomas was the lone exception due to his transfer to the University of Alabama at Birmingham following the Fall Semester of 1975. The Charter for the Chapter became official on March 23, 1976, including the names of the five Charter Members, and the chapter was anointed as the THETA DELTA CHAPTER.Since that time, Theta Delta has been a beacon of light to the community, and produced some of the most influential men around the University and the world.</p>", "Summary": "Sigma, Phi Beta Sigma, The Fraternity of Inclusiveness, founded on January 9, 1914 on the Campus of Howard University in Washington, DC.

A country, business, or family should not spend more money than it takes in. High debts ruin economic potential, plague private investment, and jeopardize the future generations chance to enjoy prosperity. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_text_exposed_show\"><strong>WE BELIEVE: In an Informed Electorate.</strong> The greatest solution to combating generational theft is an electorate that understands the issues, civics, and basic governmental policy. With a more informed electorate, old political talking points of the past will no longer be viable, candidates will be forced to stand behind their principles, and pressured to execute beneficial public policy. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_text_exposed_show\"><strong>WE BELIEVE: In the Power of the Youth</strong>. With over 46 million younger citizens eligible to vote in 2012 alone and millions more each year, younger generations are this country&rsquo;s fastest growing demographic. If we do not target the youth, debts will become a habit, and our republic will be forever lost. </span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_text_exposed_show\"><strong>WE BELIEVE: In an Independent Approach.</strong> Turning Point USA does not stand on party, rather on principle.

The power of freedom and liberty is a force that can overcome a government bureaucrat, agency, or even politician. The root of Turning Point USA is an optimistic approach, and the core belief that tomorrow will be more prosperous.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_text_exposed_show\">The main goal of this Turning Point chapter is to educate. We will table on campus every other week&nbsp;in order to distribute educational material and recruit new members.

Other activism events will be planned, for example \"National Debt Awareness Week\", a national initiative to educate students on the existence of national debt. &nbsp;Another goal of this chapter is voter registration. With the 2016 election coming up soon, we believe it is vital to get students on campus registered to vote, no matter their home state.&nbsp;</span>As a non-partisan organization, Turning Point does not focus on any political parties or specific polititians.

The Alabama Delta Chapter of AED holds an initiation ceremony once per year in the spring semester to recognize those students who have met the requirements for national membership. Associate membership forms can be picked up at any general business meeting, or at the front desk of HHB 402 (CAS Advising Office). Completed forms can then be submitted to HHB 402 along with the associate membership fee. Requests to join AED on Engage will be marked as \"Pending\" until membership forms and fees have been received.&nbsp;</p>", "Summary": "Alpha Epsilon Delta is the National Pre-Health Honor Society.

These five women, also known as our Five Pearls, dared to depart from the traditional coalitions for black women and sought to establish a new organization predicated on the precepts of Scholarship, Service, Sisterly Love and Finer Womanhood. It was the ideal of the Founders that the Sorority would reach college women in all parts of the country who were sorority minded and desired to follow the founding principles of the organization. Founder Viola Tyler was oft quoted to say \"[In the ideal collegiate situation] there is a Zeta in a girl regardless of race, creed, or color, who has high standards and principles, a good scholarly average and an active interest in all things that she undertakes to accomplish.\" Since its inception, the Sorority has chronicled a number of firsts. Zeta Phi Beta was the first Greek-letter organization to charter a chapter in Africa (1948); to form adult and youth auxiliary groups; to centralize its operations in a national headquarters; and to be constitutionally bound to a fraternity, Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Incorporated. Zeta's national and local programs include endowment of its National Educational Foundation, community outreach services and support of multiple affiliate organizations. Zeta chapters and auxiliary groups have given untotaled hours of voluntary service to educate the public, assist youth, provide scholarships, support organized charities and promote legislation for social and civic change. A nonprofit organization, Zeta Phi Beta is incorporated in Washington, D.C. and in the state of Illinois. The dues and gifts of its members support the Sorority. Over the years since the sorority's inception, Zeta Phi Beta has chartered hundreds of chapters and initiated thousands of women around the world. Zeta has continued to thrive and flourish while adapting to the ever-changing needs of a new century. Despite the Great Depression, discrimination and segregation and a host of other challenges, Zeta has continued to hold true to its ideals and purpose, for, as stated by one of the Sorority's founding members: \"&hellip;I believe that no [other] organization could have been founded upon principles that were so near and dear to all of our hearts.\" (Founder Myrtle Tyler)</p>", "Summary": "Founded January 16, 1920, Zeta began as an idea conceived by five coeds at Howard University in Washington D.C.: Arizona Cleaver, Myrtle Tyler, Viola Tyler, Fannie Pettie and Pearl Neal.
